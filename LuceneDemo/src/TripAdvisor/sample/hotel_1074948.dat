<Content>Great Choice for Tokyo University Area Nicer than the average business hotel, this is a great place to stay if you have business at Tokyo University. Not convenient as a base for tourists, though.It's in a very quiet neighborhood about 2 blocks from the Main Gate of the University. Rooms are of decent size. The restaurant is nice and the the vending machines have everything you might need.
